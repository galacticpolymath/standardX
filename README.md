# A collection of the major learning standards in US public schools
scripts for downloading and manipulating the major national learning standards for K-12:
- [Next Generation Science Standards](https://www.nextgenscience.org/)
- [Common Core ELA (English Language Arts)](http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/)
- [Common Core Math](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/)
- [College, Career, and Civic Life (C3) Social Studies Framework](https://www.socialstudies.org/standards/c3)

I've also included the UN Sustainable Development Goals. These are incredibly ambitious goals set by the international community to (among other things) eliminate poverty, hunger, gender inequality, fight climate change, and preserve 10% of terrestrial and marine habitat by 2030. These goals are aspirational, of course, but students need to see that there's hope and solutions to all the depressing problems we hear about on a daily basis. Here's a succinct, and inspiring explanation of why we should #teachSDGs by human rights advocate Malala Yousafzai:
